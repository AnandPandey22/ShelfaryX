# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Guide for ShelfaryX

## 📋 Prerequisites
- ✅ ShelfaryX project is working locally
- ✅ Supabase project is set up and working
- ✅ Git repository is ready

## 🔧 Step 1: Prepare Your Project

### 1.1 Build Your Project Locally
```bash
npm run build
```
This will create a `dist` folder with your production build.

### 1.2 Test the Build
```bash
npm run preview
```
Make sure everything works in the production build.

## 🌐 Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

### 2.1 Connect to Netlify
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up/Login with your GitHub account
3. Click "New site from Git"

### 2.2 Choose Your Repository
1. Select your ShelfaryX repository
2. Choose the branch (usually `main` or `master`)

### 2.3 Configure Build Settings
```
Build command: npm run build
Publish directory: dist
```

## 🔐 Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

### 3.1 In Netlify Dashboard
1. Go to your site settings
2. Navigate to "Environment variables"
3. Add these variables:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL = YOUR-SUPABASE-URL
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = YOUR-SUPABSE-ANON-KEY
```

### 3.2 Redeploy After Adding Variables
1. Go to "Deploys" tab
2. Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"

## 🛠️ Step 4: Troubleshooting

### 4.1 Common Issues

#### Issue: Environment Variables Not Working
**Solution:**
- Make sure variables start with `VITE_`
- Redeploy after adding variables
- Check Netlify build logs

#### Issue: Supabase Connection Fails
**Solution:**
- Verify Supabase URL and key are correct
- Check Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) settings
- Ensure your Supabase project is active

#### Issue: Build Fails
**Solution:**
- Check build logs in Netlify
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Test build locally first

### 4.2 Debug Environment Variables
Add this to your code temporarily to debug:
```javascript
console.log('Supabase URL:', import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL);
console.log('Supabase Key:', import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY ? 'Found' : 'Missing');
```

## 🔒 Step 5: Security Considerations

### 5.1 Environment Variables
- ✅ **Safe to Expose**: `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is safe for client-side use
- ✅ **Public Key**: This is the public anon key, not the service role key
- ✅ **RLS Protection**: Supabase Row Level Security protects your data

### 5.2 Supabase Security
- ✅ **Enable RLS**: Make sure Row Level Security is enabled on all tables
- ✅ **Proper Policies**: Set up appropriate access policies
- ✅ **Service Role Key**: Never expose the service role key

## 📱 Step 6: Custom Domain (Optional)

### 6.1 Add Custom Domain
1. Go to "Domain settings" in Netlify
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Follow the DNS configuration instructions

### 6.2 SSL Certificate
- ✅ **Automatic**: Netlify provides free SSL certificates
- ✅ **HTTPS**: Your site will be served over HTTPS

## 🎯 Step 7: Post-Deployment Checklist

- ✅ [ ] Site loads without errors
- ✅ [ ] Login functionality works
- ✅ [ ] Database operations work (CRUD)
- ✅ [ ] Invoice generation works
- ✅ [ ] All features are functional
- ✅ [ ] Mobile responsiveness works
- ✅ [ ] Performance is acceptable

## 🔄 Step 8: Continuous Deployment

### 8.1 Automatic Deploys
- ✅ **Git Integration**: Every push to main branch triggers deploy
- ✅ **Preview Deploys**: Pull requests get preview URLs
- ✅ **Rollback**: Easy to rollback to previous versions

### 8.2 Environment Management
- ✅ **Production**: Main branch deploys to production
- ✅ **Staging**: Create staging branch for testing
- ✅ **Development**: Local development with local Supabase
